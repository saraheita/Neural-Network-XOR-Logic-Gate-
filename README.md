# Neural-Network-XOR-Logic-Gate-
This code implements a neural network in TensorFlow to learn the XOR function. It uses a multi-layer perceptron with a hidden layer to overcome the limitations of a single neuron, which cannot model XOR. The network is trained using gradient descent and binary cross-entropy loss.
